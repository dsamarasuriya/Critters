resolve stuff at end of time step
Wordl time step:
***1 & 2 are in time step function of each critter 
1) Must move to new position (Run or Walk)
	- Cannot move twice (calling run and/or walk twice).
	  If done, must deduct energy but not move twice.
2) If 2 or more critters in a position, must resolve
	- Only one critter can remain 
	- Can be fighting, reproduction, etc
	- Can use run or walk in fight scenarios. 
	  	-Must charge energy cost even if they attempt to walk/run and fail
	  	-Must
3) All new critters are added to the population 
	- If a new critter is made during the timestep
	  do NOT resolve with other critters in same position
4) Delete any dead critters (energy == 0)
	- Apply rest energy to critter first before deciding if they are dead  
5) Add Algae to the world 



Critters:

1) Fighter (chance to crit)
2) Reproducer
